# Text Preprocessing & Ensemble Learning (Voting + Stacking)

## Short Description
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end machine learning (NLP) workflow for text classification**, focusing on **text preprocessing** and **ensemble learning techniques** such as **Voting Classifier** and **Stacking Classifier**.  
It is designed as a **learning-oriented, example project** that showcases practical knowledge of NLP pipelines, model evaluation, and ensemble strategies.

## Tech Stack / Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Features
- Comprehensive **text preprocessing pipeline**
-  Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)
-  Multiple **base ML models** for text classification
-  **Voting Classifier** (Hard & Soft Voting)
-  **Stacking Ensemble** with meta-learner
-  Model performance comparison using standard metrics
-  Clear evaluation and result interpretation

---

## Dataset / Inputs
- Text-based dataset (e.g., reviews, comments, or documents)
- Input format:
  - **Text column:** Raw textual data
  - **Label column:** Target class/category

> Dataset is not fixed — users are encouraged to plug in their own datasets.

## How It Works (High-Level Overview)
1. **Data Loading**
   - Load and inspect the text dataset
2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal
   - Tokenization and stopword removal
   - Vectorization using TF-IDF or Bag of Words
3. **Model Training**
   - Train individual base models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)
4. **Ensemble Learning**
   - Combine models using:
     - Voting Classifier
     - Stacking Classifier
5. **Evaluation**
   - Compare base models vs ensemble models
6. **Result Analysis**
   - Interpret metrics and identify performance improvements

## Model Performance & Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics Used
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

### Observations
- Ensemble models generally outperform individual models
- Stacking provides better generalization in most cases
- Voting works well when base models are diverse

---

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on:
  - Dataset quality
  - Feature engineering
- Not optimized for very large-scale datasets
- Limited hyperparameter tuning (can be improved)
- Deep learning models (e.g., Transformers) not included
