# Google Play Store Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic modeling on **Google Play Store app data**. The goal is to understand app market trends, user preferences, pricing strategies, and factors influencing app ratings and installs.

The notebook walks through data inspection, cleaning, visualization, and feature-driven insights that can help developers and product teams make data-informed decisions.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

* Analyze app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and pricing
* Identify patterns affecting app popularity and user engagement
* Explore relationships between ratings, reviews, installs, and app size
* Prepare data for basic machine learning experiments

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is the **Google Play Store Apps dataset**, which typically includes:

* App name
* Category
* Rating
* Reviews
* Size
* Installs
* Type (Free / Paid)
* Price
* Content rating
* Genres

> Dataset quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers are handled during preprocessing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Plotly** – interactive visualizations
* **Scikit-learn** – basic preprocessing and modeling utilities

---

## 🔍 Notebook Workflow

### 1. Initial Inspection

* Load and preview the dataset
* Understand data types and structure
* Identify missing and inconsistent values

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Handle missing ratings and reviews
* Convert installs and price into numeric formats
* Remove or treat outliers
* Encode categorical variables where needed

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Category-wise app distribution
* Rating distribution across categories
* Free vs Paid app comparisons
* Relationship between installs, reviews, and ratings
* Price impact on ratings and installs

### 4. Feature Preparation & Modeling (Introductory)

* Feature selection and scaling
* Train-test split
* Applying basic machine learning models for insight exploration

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Free apps dominate the Play Store ecosystem
* Certain categories consistently achieve higher ratings
* Apps with higher reviews generally correlate with higher installs
* Paid apps tend to have higher ratings but significantly fewer installs
